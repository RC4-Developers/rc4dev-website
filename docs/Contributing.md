## Recommended Guidelines for Contribution

### Git Flow

As mentioned in the [README](README.md), this codebase uses the git flow branching model. Please read
the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) article to learn more about the git flow
branching model.

As much as possible, another person (preferably a maintainer) should review your code before merging it into the main
branch.

### Commit Messages

As much as possible, please follow the [Git Conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification for commit messages. This will help to keep the commit history clean and easy to understand.

### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue and tag it; it's that easy! Please
provide as much information as possible, including screenshots, to help future developers quickly fix the raised issues.

If you feel that the bug is a "Good First Issue" (an issue that is easy to fix/good for onboarding), please tag it as
such.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We use GitHub issues to track enhancements. Suggest an enhancement by opening a new issue, and tag it as such. Please
provide as much information as possible, including possible mockups and screenshots, to help future developers quickly
implement the suggested enhancements.

If you feel that an enhancement is a "Good First Issue" (an issue that is easy to fix/good for onboarding), please tag
it as such.
